### Pretraining Method for Histopathology Images with Limited Data Using Multi-Task Learning: Zoom Scale Estimation and Image Puzzle Solving

In histopathology image analysis, the lack of large annotated datasets poses a significant challenge for training high-performance machine learning models. To address this issue, we propose a **multi-task learning (MTL)** approach for pretraining models on limited data. Our method incorporates two tasks: **zoom scale estimation** and **image puzzle solving**. These tasks help the model develop transferable representations for downstream tasks like tumor classification and tissue segmentation.

#### 1. **Task 1: Zoom Scale Estimation**

Histopathology images are often captured at varying magnification levels, which reveal different structural details. The zoom scale estimation task teaches the model to recognize and differentiate between these magnification levels.

- **Objective**: The model predicts the zoom scale of an image, selected from one of four discrete magnifications: **x1**, **x1.2**, **x1.4**, and **x1.6**.
  
- **Implementation**:
  - **Labels**: Images are labeled based on their zoom level.
  - **Model Design**: The shared layers of the model extract general features, which are passed to a classification head to predict one of the four zoom scales.

- **Learning Outcome**: This task ensures the model learns multi-scale features, enabling it to process images effectively across varying zoom levels in downstream tasks.

#### 2. **Task 2: Image Puzzle Solving**

To develop spatial awareness and contextual understanding, the model is tasked with solving a puzzle constructed from an image divided into four parts, each from a different zoom scale.

- **Objective**: The model receives four patches from the same image, taken at **x1**, **x1.2**, **x1.4**, and **x1.6**, and predicts their correct spatial arrangement (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).

- **Implementation**:
  - **Image Division**: Each image is divided into 4 quadrants, with each quadrant corresponding to a different zoom scale.
  - **Puzzle Reconstruction**: The model classifies the relative positions of the patches using features extracted from the shared layers.

- **Learning Outcome**: By solving the puzzle, the model learns spatial coherence and multi-scale context, crucial for understanding complex tissue structures in histopathology.

#### 3. **Multi-Task Learning Framework**

The model trains on the two tasks simultaneously, leveraging a shared feature extractor and task-specific output heads. The joint learning process ensures the model captures robust and transferable features.

- **Loss Function**: The combined loss function for multi-task learning is:

  \[
  L_{\text{total}} = \lambda_1 L_{\text{scale}} + \lambda_2 L_{\text{puzzle}}
  \]

  Here, \(L_{\text{scale}}\) and \(L_{\text{puzzle}}\) are the losses for zoom scale estimation and puzzle solving, respectively, and \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\) are weights balancing the tasks.

#### 4. **Transfer Learning for Downstream Tasks**

After pretraining, the model can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks, such as tumor classification or tissue segmentation. Fine-tuning benefits from the multi-task pretraining, as the model has already learned essential multi-scale and spatial features.

- **Fine-Tuning Strategy**:
  - The shared feature extractor is initially frozen, allowing only the task-specific layers to adapt to the new task.
  - Gradual unfreezing of shared layers can be applied to further fine-tune the model.

- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques such as rotations, flips, and color jittering are used to maximize performance, especially when annotated data is scarce.

#### 5. **Evaluation and Results**

The following table highlights the performance of the pretrained model compared to a baseline model trained from scratch, using limited annotated data:

| **Model**           | **Data**               | **Acc**   |
|----------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Resnet-34    | BRACS  | 77%     |
| Resnet-34 (with Pretraining) | BRACS             | 79%     |
| Resnet-34    | Breakhis-400x  | 85.3%     |
| Resnet-34 (with Pretraining) | Breakhis-400x             | 94%     |
| VGG-19   | BRACS  | 75%     |
| Resnet-34 (with Pretraining) | BRACS             | 94%     |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Handling Limited Data**: By leveraging multi-task pretraining, the model achieves better accuracy with limited annotated data compared to training from scratch.
2. **Zoom-Level Awareness**: The zoom scale estimation task enables the model to learn multi-scale features, enhancing its ability to process images at different magnifications.
3. **Spatial Understanding**: The puzzle-solving task fosters spatial coherence, improving the model's ability to interpret complex tissue structures.
4. **Transferability**: Features learned during pretraining are highly transferable, making the model adaptable to a variety of downstream tasks.

This pretraining method is particularly effective for histopathology images, where understanding multi-scale features and spatial relationships is critical. By combining **zoom scale estimation** and **image puzzle solving**, the model learns robust and generalizable features, resulting in significant performance improvements on downstream tasks.
